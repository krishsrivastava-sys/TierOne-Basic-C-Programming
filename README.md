# **Krish Srivastava - My Passion**
**Hey there!** I'm Krish Srivastava, an Indian developer, and I'm currently 18 years, 10 months, and 12 days old as I write this.

Before diving into the details of this repository, let me share a bit about myself.

It all started in February 2020 when the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, declared a lockdown across the country. This had a significant impact on the entire nation.

One of the major effects was that people from all generations became more active online. This was especially true for me.

During this period, schools transitioned to online classes, and I was in the 9th grade. My school, The Millennium School in Lucknow, made the switch to online mode quite early.

Having unlimited access to the internet during this time opened up a world of possibilities for me.

I discovered something truly fascinating: we could write code on a computer, and it would turn into software! The idea that I could create a website or develop amazing games thrilled me to my core. The thought of making something cool that others would love to use became my goal.

I also learned about Discord applications during this time. I had already been using Discord since around 6th or 7th grade, so I was somewhat familiar with its bot functionalities. However, I never realized that I could create bots using a similar method. This discovery set me on a clear path.

And thus, my journey began.

I started pursuing programming, a passion that now defines me. As a beginner, I scoured the internet for resources on how to make Discord bots. I stumbled across various websites and eventually created a basic bot. However, it didn't feel alive because I hadn‚Äôt developed it myself.

So, I decided to learn coding. But I wasn‚Äôt sure where to start.

That's when I found a YouTuber named Tomato6966, who specialized in developing Discord bots. I would watch his videos and meticulously copy and paste every line of code he wrote.

And voil√†! The bots worked! Unbeknownst to me, the seed of programming had been planted within me.

From that point on, I couldn‚Äôt stop. I started writing lines and lines of code daily‚Äîsometimes over 10,000 lines! This passion continued into my 10th and 11th grades as well.

Unfortunately, I had to put programming on hold during my 12th grade, which caused me to forget a lot of what I had learned.

Now, I‚Äôm a first-year Bachelor of Engineering student, specializing in Computer Science and Engineering at Chandigarh University.

That year away from coding instilled a fear in me: What if I couldn‚Äôt code again?

Fortunately, fate had other plans, and now I have the opportunity to pursue my passion once more.

This time, I have a different goal: I aspire to create the greatest software that exists‚Äîdeveloping applications that the world will admire.

This is my passion for programming.

# **What is this repository?**
> This Respository consists of all of the programming i would do in the process of programming for my Tier-1 Series.

What this tier is? Well it consists of most basic projects for the C programming language. We would be slowly moving up on the Tiers as i would keep increasing the difficulty of the projects.

It's like going to a gym. Currently i'm a newbie, Tomorrow i might be the weight lifting champion.
